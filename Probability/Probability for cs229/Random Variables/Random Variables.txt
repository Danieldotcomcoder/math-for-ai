Here are some of the most frequently used functions of random variables in machine learning:

Probability Mass Function (PMF) for discrete variables:

Assigns probabilities to each possible value of a discrete random variable.
Used for calculating probabilities of specific events, constructing histograms, and fitting probability distributions to data.
Probability Density Function (PDF) for continuous variables:

Describes the relative likelihood of different values within a continuous range.
Used for visualizing distributions, calculating probabilities of falling within intervals, and fitting continuous probability distributions.
Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):

Gives the probability that a random variable will be less than or equal to a certain value.
Used for visualizing distributions, identifying outliers, calculating quantiles, and conducting hypothesis testing.
Expected Value (Mean):

Represents the average or central value of a distribution.
Used for summarizing data, making predictions, and understanding model behavior.
Variance:

Measures the spread or dispersion of a distribution around its mean.
Used for assessing uncertainty, understanding model variability, and selecting appropriate algorithms.
Covariance and Correlation:

Quantify the relationship between two random variables.
Used for understanding feature relationships, identifying patterns, and constructing multivariate models.
Conditional Distributions:

Describe the distribution of one variable given the value of another.
Used for understanding conditional relationships, making predictions based on partial information, and constructing Bayesian models.
Moments:

Statistical measures that describe the shape of a distribution.
Commonly used moments include mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
Used for characterizing distributions and comparing different models.
These functions are essential for:

Modeling uncertainty: Representing uncertainty in data and model predictions.
Understanding data: Analyzing data distributions and relationships between variables.
Building machine learning models: Constructing and training various algorithms.
Evaluating model performance: Assessing model accuracy, reliability, and robustness.
Making predictions: Generating probabilistic predictions and understanding their confidence levels.
