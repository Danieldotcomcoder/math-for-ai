Example:

Suppose you roll a fair six-sided die once. What's the PMF of the number you roll?

Solution:

Identify the possible values: The random variable X (the number rolled) can take on values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Assign probabilities: Since the die is fair, each outcome has an equal probability:

- P(X = 1) = 1/6
- P(X = 2) = 1/6
- P(X = 3) = 1/6
- P(X = 4) = 1/6
- P(X = 5) = 1/6
- P(X = 6) = 1/6

Represent the PMF: You can express the PMF as a table or a formula:

**Table:**

| Value of X | Probability |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 1          | 1/6         |
| 2          | 1/6         |
| 3          | 1/6         |
| 4          | 1/6         |
| 5          | 1/6         |
| 6          | 1/6         |

**Formula:**

P(X = x) = 1/6, for x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Key points:

- The PMF assigns probabilities to each possible discrete value.
- The probabilities must add up to 1.
- The PMF helps you calculate probabilities of specific events, like the probability of rolling an even number (P(X = 2, 4, or 6) = 1/2).
