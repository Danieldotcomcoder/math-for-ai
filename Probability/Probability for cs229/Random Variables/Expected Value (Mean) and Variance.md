Question: A fair die is rolled 10 times. Let X be the number of times that a 6 appears. What are the expected value and variance of X?

Answer: X is a binomial random variable with n = 10 and p = 1/6. The expected value and variance of a binomial random variable are given by:

E(X) = np

Var(X) = np(1-p)

Substituting the values of n and p, we get:

E(X) = 10 x (1/6) = 5/3

Var(X) = 10 x (1/6) x (5/6) = 25/18

Therefore, the expected value and variance of X are 5/3 and 25/18, respectively.
